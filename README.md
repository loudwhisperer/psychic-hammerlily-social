# psychic-hammerlily-social

## Description
The Psychic Hammerlily Social Application replaces the need for a backend only application that can only be run via the API, so forget facebook, forget instagram who needs a GUI when you have pure BSON returns. You can create a user, add friends and even add thoughts and react to them all without any intuitive way to do it.

This ones biggest challenge for me was a small thing that made me laugh at myself quite a bit. In a couple words always add parentheses to the end of your router methods. Besides that this made me want to continue getting better with database construction and management.

## Installation

- To install The Psychic Hammerlily Social application simply pull the SSH Link from the bright green code button in GitHub.
- Open up your terminal on your local machine and naviage to a directory you would like to store the code for this in type git clone then paste the SSH Link and hit enter.
- Once done you will have the full repo then it is just a matter of changing directories to The Psychic Hammerlily Social  application and using your preffered method for opening it in a code editor.
